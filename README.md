# MTLComb: multi-task learning combing regression and classification tasks with joint feature selection


## Introduction
Multi-task learning (MTL) is a machine learning technique for the simultaneously learn-ing of multiple, ‘communicating’ algorithms. The currently available MTL algorithms have been de-signed for either regression or classification tasks, but no solutions exist that allow for the joint learning of these task types, limiting the utility of MTL with regards to interesting biomedical applications. We developed MTLComb, a novel methodology and software for MTL that can learn re-gression and classification tasks simultaneously and includes regularization to identify predictors of relevance for all tasks. We provide a mathematical derivation of the algorithm and demonstrate its utility using simulation data.
